# Server Side Vein Mine
This is a fabric server mod to add vein mining. Fabric API is the only dependency. Compatible with 1.21

To modify the acceptable blocks, you can edit serverveinmine.config.json you must reload the server.

**Note** This is an alpha, I do not intend to move away of xapple's betterconfig, but this branch will be updated with new releases that aren't compatible until beterconfig is.
